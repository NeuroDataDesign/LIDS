# About  

The LIDS pipeline will ingest two-photon microscopy images of mouse cerebral cortex and autonomously detect and characterize excitatory synapses located at dendritic spines expressing AMPA receptor.

Current methods of detecting synapses are limited to manually annotating them or generating a probability map, as described in  [Probabilistic fluorescence-based synapse detection](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005493)
