# Motivation 

The identification and characterization of synapses within the central nervous system is critical to elucidating the pathophysiology of neurological disorders. Due to their diverse functions and heterogeneous gene expression, however, synapses remain poorly understood and often undetectable. The most promising imaginge technique currently implemented for synapse visualization is electron microsopy, which is an expensive and time-consuming method. Furthemore, electron microscopy precludes the possibility for in vivo imaging of cortical tissues and longitudinal tracking of synapses. Optimization of computational approaches to analyzing two-photon microscopy images might provide a more cost- and time-effective means to identifying single synapses within the brain. The LIDS pipeline will use two-photon microscopy images of mouse cerebral cortex to autonomously detect and characterize excitatory synapses located at dendritic spines expressing AMPA receptors. 

# Mission 

The mission of LIDS is to accelerate the pace of neuroscience research by providing user-friendly software to practicing brain scientists interested in autonomously detecting and characterizing synapses. 

# Problem 

The existing algorithms utilized for synapse visualization are difficult to use and require expert knowledge in the fields of machine learning and image processing. For neuroscientists, implementing such algorithms is an arudous process that takes away from valuable time that could be spent developing experiments and gathering data.
