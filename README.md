# Motivation 

The identification and characterization of synapses within the central nervous system is critical to elucidating the pathophysiology of neurological disorders. Due to their diverse functions and heterogeneous gene expression, however, synapses remain poorly understood and often undetectable. The most promising imaging technique currently implemented for synapse visualization is electron microsopy, which is an expensive and time-consuming method to perform. Furthemore, electron microscopy precludes the possibility for in vivo imaging of cortical tissues and longitudinal tracking of synapses. Optimization of computational approaches to analyzing two-photon microscopy images might provide a more cost- and time-effective means to identifying single synapses within the brain. The LIDS pipeline will use two-photon microscopy images of mouse cerebral cortex to autonomously detect and characterize excitatory synapses located at dendritic spines expressing AMPA receptors. 

# Mission 

The mission of LIDS is to accelerate the pace of neuroscience research by providing user-friendly software to practicing brain scientists interested in autonomously detecting and characterizing synapses. 

# Problem 

The existing algorithms utilized for synapse visualization are difficult to use and require expert knowledge in the fields of machine learning and image processing. For neuroscientists, implementing such algorithms is an arudous process that takes away from valuable time that could be spent developing experiments and gathering data. 

# Current Best Practices 

While enhancing resolution and overall image quality of various microscopy techniques is a necessary component to the advancement of biomedicine, it is worthwhile to explore the potential of computational techqniques in improving the quality of existing imaging modalities. LIDS aims to increase the value of two-photon microscopy as a visualization tool by extracting meaningful information from each image taken regarding synapse detection and syanpse maturation over time. Instead of utilizing electron microscopy as a visualization tool, which is an expensive method to carry out, LIDS will focus on increasing the computational efficacy of identidying synapses within two-photon microscopy images of mouse cerebral cortex. 

# Solution 

In order to bind together the computer science and neuroscience research communities, it is important to develop a computational tool that is both informative and user-friendly. LIDS will aim to provide an opensource, well-documented software that is accessible to neuroscientists and computer scientists alike for the purpose of advancing neuroscience research, with particular regard to synapse identification and longitudinal tracking.
